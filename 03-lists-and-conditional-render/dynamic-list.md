# Dynamic lists

We can use JavaScript Map function to achieve some dynamic content in our code.
Like we used `{}` inside the JSX which evaluates a JavaScript expression.
`map` method returns a single array. So in order to achieve this inside map function we can actually return JSX content.

## Using state to handle dynamic content.

Keys are to allow react to keep track of individual elements so that it has a clear property it can compare with other elements and decide render.
